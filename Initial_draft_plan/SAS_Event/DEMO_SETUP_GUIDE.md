   ```

## 🎪 Live Demo Execution

### 🎬 Pre-Demo (30 seconds before)

1. **Reset all systems:**
   ```bash
   # Reset the visual timer
   # Click "Reset" button on countdown_timer.html
   ```

2. **Announce to crowd:**
   > "Ladies and gentlemen, we're about to show you how Thakral One can take your SAS models from development to production in under 5 minutes. Watch the timer and traffic light!"

### 🚀 Demo Execution (5 minutes)

#### Step 1: Start the Visual Timer (10 seconds)
```bash
# Click "Start Demo" on countdown_timer.html
# Traffic light should turn RED
```

**Say to audience:**
> "The timer is running! Watch as we go from SAS Model Studio to live production API."

#### Step 2: Export SAS Model (30 seconds)
```sas
/* Run this in your SAS session */
%include "C:\SAS_Event_Demo\model_studio_automation.sas";
```

**Say to audience:**
> "Our data scientist just completed a credit risk model in SAS Model Studio. The model artifacts are being automatically exported..."

#### Step 3: Automatic Git Sync (45 seconds)
The git sync automation should detect the SAS output and:
- Convert model artifacts to the expected format
- Commit changes to Git
- Trigger the GitHub Actions pipeline

**Say to audience:**
> "The model is now committed to Git, and our CI/CD pipeline is automatically building a container. Notice the status updates on screen!"

#### Step 4: Watch the Pipeline (3-4 minutes)
Monitor the GitHub Actions workflow:
- Container building
- Automated testing
- Production deployment

**Say to audience:**
> "While this runs, let me explain: SAS gives you industry-grade models, but the typical 4-6 week delay to get them into production is what we eliminate. We're now at the testing phase - see the yellow light!"

#### Step 5: Production Ready! (Final 30 seconds)
When complete:
- Traffic light turns GREEN
- Success celebration with flashing lights
- QR code appears for live testing

**Say to audience:**
> "And we're live! The traffic light is green, meaning our model is now serving predictions in production. Please scan the QR code with your phone to test it yourself!"

### 🎊 Post-Demo Interaction (2-3 minutes)

1. **Invite audience to test:**
   - QR code leads to simple web form
   - They input customer data
   - Get real-time credit risk prediction

2. **Key talking points:**
   - "4-6 weeks reduced to 4-5 minutes"
   - "Full enterprise governance maintained"
   - "Your existing SAS investment, amplified"
   - "Focus on model development, not infrastructure"

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide

### ❌ Common Issues

1. **SAS network path errors:**
   ```bash

   ```bash
   # Check the sync service is running
   ps aux | grep git_sync_automation
   # Manually trigger if needed
   touch "C:\SAS_Event_Demo\git_sync\trigger_deployment.flag"
   ```

3. **GitHub Actions not starting:**
